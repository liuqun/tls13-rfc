</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The primary goal of TLS is to provide a secure channel between two communicating peers; the only requirement from the underlying transport is a reliable, in-order data stream. Specifically, the secure channel should provide the following properties:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Authentication: The server side of the channel is always authenticated; the client side is optionally authenticated. Authentication can happen via asymmetric cryptography (e.g., RSA <a href="#RSA" class="xref">[RSA]</a>, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) <a href="#ECDSA" class="xref">[ECDSA]</a>, or the Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) <a href="#RFC8032" class="xref">[RFC8032]</a>) or a symmetric pre-shared key (PSK).</li>
<li>Confidentiality: Data sent over the channel after establishment is only visible to the endpoints. TLS does not hide the length of the data it transmits, though endpoints are able to pad TLS records in order to obscure lengths and improve protection against traffic analysis techniques.</li>
<li>Integrity: Data sent over the channel after establishment cannot be modified by attackers without detection.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">These properties should be true even in the face of an attacker who has complete control of the network, as described in <a href="#RFC3552" class="xref">[RFC3552]</a>.  See <a href="#security-analysis" class="xref">Appendix E</a> for a more complete statement of the relevant security properties.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">TLS consists of two primary components:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>A handshake protocol (<a href="#handshake-protocol" class="xref">Section 4</a>) that authenticates the communicating parties, negotiates cryptographic modes and parameters, and establishes shared keying material. The handshake protocol is designed to resist tampering; an active attacker should not be able to force the peers to negotiate different parameters than they would if the connection were not under attack.</li>
<li>A record protocol (<a href="#record-protocol" class="xref">Section 5</a>) that uses the parameters established by the handshake protocol to protect traffic between the communicating peers. The record protocol divides traffic up into a series of records, each of which is independently protected using the traffic keys.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">TLS is application protocol independent; higher-level protocols can layer on top of TLS transparently. The TLS standard, however, does not specify how protocols add security with TLS; how to initiate TLS handshaking and how to interpret the authentication certificates exchanged are left to the judgment of the designers and implementors of protocols that run on top of TLS.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">This document defines TLS version 1.3. While TLS 1.3 is not directly compatible with previous versions, all versions of TLS incorporate a versioning mechanism which allows clients and servers to interoperably negotiate a common version if one is supported by both peers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.8">This document supersedes and obsoletes previous versions of TLS, including version 1.2 <a href="#RFC5246" class="xref">[RFC5246]</a>.  It also obsoletes the TLS ticket mechanism defined in <a href="#RFC5077" class="xref">[RFC5077]</a> and replaces it with the mechanism defined in <a href="#resumption-and-psk" class="xref">Section 2.2</a>.  Because TLS 1.3 changes the way keys are derived, it updates <a href="#RFC5705" class="xref">[RFC5705]</a> as described in <a href="#exporters" class="xref">Section 7.5</a>. It also changes how Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) messages are carried and therefore updates <a href="#RFC6066" class="xref">[RFC6066]</a> and obsoletes <a href="#RFC6961" class="xref">[RFC6961]</a> as described in <a href="#ocsp-and-sct" class="xref">Section 4.4.2.1</a>.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.1">The following is a list of the major functional differences between TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3. It is not intended to be exhaustive, and there are many minor differences.</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The list of supported symmetric encryption algorithms has been pruned of all algorithms that are considered legacy. Those that remain are all Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms. The cipher suite concept has been changed to separate the authentication and key exchange mechanisms from the record protection algorithm (including secret key length) and a hash to be used with both the key derivation function and handshake message authentication code (MAC).</li>
<li>A zero round-trip time (0-RTT) mode was added, saving a round trip at connection setup for some application data, at the cost of certain security properties.</li>
<li>Static RSA and Diffie-Hellman cipher suites have been removed; all public-key based key exchange mechanisms now provide forward secrecy.</li>
<li>All handshake messages after the ServerHello are now encrypted. The newly introduced EncryptedExtensions message allows various extensions previously sent in the clear in the ServerHello to also enjoy confidentiality protection.</li>
<li>The key derivation functions have been redesigned. The new design allows easier analysis by cryptographers due to their improved key separation properties. The HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF) is used as an underlying primitive.</li>
<li>The handshake state machine has been significantly restructured to be more consistent and to remove superfluous messages such as ChangeCipherSpec (except when needed for middlebox compatibility).</li>
<li>Elliptic curve algorithms are now in the base spec, and new signature algorithms, such as EdDSA, are included. TLS 1.3 removed point format negotiation in favor of a single point format for each curve.</li>
<li>Other cryptographic improvements were made, including changing the RSA padding to use the RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme (RSASSA-PSS), and the removal of compression, the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), and custom Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) groups.</li>
<li>The TLS 1.2 version negotiation mechanism has been deprecated in favor of a version list in an extension. This increases compatibility with existing servers that incorrectly implemented version negotiation.</li>
<li>Session resumption with and without server-side state as well as the PSK-based cipher suites of earlier TLS versions have been replaced by a single new PSK exchange.</li>
<li>References have been updated to point to the updated versions of RFCs, as appropriate (e.g., RFC 5280 rather than RFC 3280).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.3">1.3.</a> <a href="#updates-affecting-tls-12" id="updates-affecting-tls-12">Updates Affecting TLS 1.2</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.1">This document defines several changes that optionally affect implementations of TLS 1.2, including those which do not also support TLS 1.3:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>A version downgrade protection mechanism is described in <a href="#server-hello" class="xref">Section 4.1.3</a>.</li>
<li>RSASSA-PSS signature schemes are defined in <a href="#signature-algorithms" class="xref">Section 4.2.3</a>.</li>
<li>The "supported_versions" ClientHello extension can be used to negotiate the version of TLS to use, in preference to the legacy_version field of the ClientHello.</li>
<li>The "signature_algorithms_cert" extension allows a client to indicate which signature algorithms it can validate in X.509 certificates.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.3">Additionally, this document clarifies some compliance requirements for earlier versions of TLS; see <a href="#protocol-invariants" class="xref">Section 9.3</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#protocol-overview" id="protocol-overview">Protocol Overview</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The cryptographic parameters used by the secure channel are produced by the TLS handshake protocol. This sub-protocol of TLS is used by the client and server when first communicating with each other.  The handshake protocol allows peers to negotiate a protocol version, select cryptographic algorithms, optionally authenticate each other, and establish shared secret keying material.  Once the handshake is complete, the peers use the established keys to protect the application-layer traffic.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">A failure of the handshake or other protocol error triggers the termination of the connection, optionally preceded by an alert message (<a href="#alert-protocol" class="xref">Section 6</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.3">TLS supports three basic key exchange modes:</p>
<p></p>

<p class="figure">Figure 1: Message Flow for Full TLS Handshake</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.6">The handshake can be thought of as having three phases (indicated in the diagram above):</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Key Exchange: Establish shared keying material and select the cryptographic parameters. Everything after this phase is encrypted.</li>
<li>Server Parameters: Establish other handshake parameters (whether&#160;the client is authenticated, application-layer protocol support, etc.).</li>
<li>Authentication: Authenticate the server (and, optionally, the client) and provide key confirmation and handshake integrity.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.8">In the Key Exchange phase, the client sends the ClientHello (<a href="#client-hello" class="xref">Section 4.1.2</a>) message, which contains a random nonce (ClientHello.random); its offered protocol versions; a list of symmetric cipher/HKDF hash pairs; either a set of Diffie-Hellman key shares (in the "key_share" (<a href="#key-share" class="xref">Section 4.2.8</a>) extension), a set of pre&#8209;shared key labels (in the "pre_shared_key" (<a href="#pre-shared-key-extension" class="xref">Section 4.2.11</a>) extension), or both; and potentially additional extensions.  Additional fields and/or messages may also be present for middlebox compatibility.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.9">The server processes the ClientHello and determines the appropriate cryptographic parameters for the connection. It then responds with its own ServerHello (<a href="#server-hello" class="xref">Section 4.1.3</a>), which indicates the negotiated connection parameters. The combination of the ClientHello and the ServerHello determines the shared keys. If (EC)DHE key establishment is in use, then the ServerHello contains a "key_share" extension with the server's ephemeral Diffie-Hellman share; the server's share MUST be in the same group as one of the client's shares. If PSK key establishment is in use, then the ServerHello contains a "pre_shared_key" extension indicating which of the client's offered PSKs was selected.  Note that implementations can use (EC)DHE and PSK together, in which case both extensions will be supplied.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.10">The server then sends two messages to establish the Server Parameters:</p>

Once a handshake has completed, the server can send the client a PSK identity that corresponds to a unique key derived from the initial handshake (see <a href="#NSTMessage" class="xref">Section 4.6.1</a>). The client can then use that PSK identity in future handshakes to negotiate the use of the associated PSK. If the server accepts the PSK, then the security context of the new connection is cryptographically tied to the original connection and the key derived from the initial handshake is used to bootstrap the cryptographic state instead of a full handshake.  In TLS 1.2 and below, this functionality was provided by "session IDs" and "session tickets" <a href="#RFC5077" class="xref">[RFC5077]</a>. Both mechanisms are obsoleted in TLS 1.3.</p>

The server responds with a "pre_shared_key" extension to negotiate the use of PSK key establishment and can (as shown here) respond with a "key_share" extension to do (EC)DHE key establishment, thus providing forward secrecy.</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>A list of cipher suites which indicates the AEAD algorithm/HKDF hash pairs which the client supports.</li>
<li>A "supported_groups" (<a href="#negotiated-groups" class="xref">Section 4.2.7</a>) extension which indicates the (EC)DHE groups which the client supports and a "key_share" (<a href="#key-share" class="xref">Section 4.2.8</a>) extension which contains (EC)DHE shares for some or all of these groups.</li>
<li>A "signature_algorithms" (<a href="#signature-algorithms" class="xref">Section 4.2.3</a>) extension which indicates the signature algorithms which the client can accept. A "signature_algorithms_cert" extension (<a href="#signature-algorithms" class="xref">Section 4.2.3</a>) may also be added to indicate certificate-specific signature algorithms.</li>
<li>A "pre_shared_key" (<a href="#pre-shared-key-extension" class="xref">Section 4.2.11</a>) extension which contains a list of symmetric key identities known to the client and a "psk_key_exchange_modes" (<a href="#pre-shared-key-exchange-modes" class="xref">Section 4.2.9</a>) extension which indicates the key exchange modes that may be used with PSKs.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.3">If the server does not select a PSK, then the first three of these options are entirely orthogonal: the server independently selects a cipher suite, an (EC)DHE group and key share for key establishment, and a signature algorithm/certificate pair to authenticate itself to the client. If there is no overlap between the received "supported_groups" and the groups supported by the server, then the server MUST abort the handshake with a "handshake_failure" or an "insufficient_security" alert.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.4">If the server selects a PSK, then it MUST also select a key establishment mode from the set indicated by the client's "psk_key_exchange_modes" extension (at present, PSK alone or with (EC)DHE). Note that if the PSK can be used without (EC)DHE, then non&#8209;overlap in the "supported_groups" parameters need not be fatal, as it is in the non-PSK case discussed in the previous paragraph.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.5">If the server selects an (EC)DHE group and the client did not offer a compatible "key_share" extension in the initial ClientHello, the server MUST respond with a HelloRetryRequest (<a href="#hello-retry-request" class="xref">Section 4.1.4</a>) message.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.6">If the server successfully selects parameters and does not require a HelloRetryRequest, it indicates the selected parameters in the ServerHello as follows:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>If PSK is being used, then the server will send a "pre_shared_key" extension indicating the selected key.</li>
<li>When (EC)DHE is in use, the server will also provide a "key_share" extension. If PSK is not being used, then (EC)DHE and certificate-based authentication are always used.</li>
<li>When authenticating via a certificate, the server will send the Certificate (<a href="#certificate" class="xref">Section 4.4.2</a>) and CertificateVerify (<a href="#certificate-verify" class="xref">Section 4.4.3</a>) messages. In TLS 1.3 as defined by this document, either a PSK or a certificate is always used, but not both. Future documents may define how to use them together.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.8">If the server is unable to negotiate a supported set of parameters (i.e., there is no overlap between the client and server parameters), it MUST abort the handshake with either a "handshake_failure" or "insufficient_security" fatal alert (see <a href="#alert-protocol" class="xref">Section 6</a>).</p>

In that case, the client MUST send the same ClientHello without modification, except as follows:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>If a "key_share" extension was supplied in the HelloRetryRequest, replacing the list of shares with a list containing a single KeyShareEntry from the indicated group.</li>
<li>Removing the "early_data" extension (<a href="#early-data-indication" class="xref">Section 4.2.10</a>) if one was present. Early data is not permitted after a HelloRetryRequest.</li>
<li>Including a "cookie" extension if one was provided in the HelloRetryRequest.</li>
<li>Updating the "pre_shared_key" extension if present by recomputing the "obfuscated_ticket_age" and binder values and (optionally) removing any PSKs which are incompatible with the server's indicated cipher suite.</li>
<li>Optionally adding, removing, or changing the length of the "padding" extension <a href="#RFC7685" class="xref">[RFC7685]</a>.</li>

<dd style="margin-left: 8">In previous versions of TLS, this field was used for version negotiation and represented the highest version number supported by the client.  Experience has shown that many servers do not properly implement version negotiation, leading to "version intolerance" in which the server rejects an otherwise acceptable ClientHello with a version number higher than it supports. In TLS&#160;1.3, the client indicates its version preferences in the "supported_versions" extension (<a href="#supported-versions" class="xref">Section 4.2.1</a>) and the legacy_version field MUST be set to 0x0303, which is the version number for TLS 1.2.  TLS 1.3 ClientHellos are identified as having a legacy_version of 0x0303 and a supported_versions extension present with 0x0304 as the highest version indicated therein.

A client which has a cached session ID set by a pre-TLS 1.3 server SHOULD set this field to that value. In compatibility mode (see <a href="#middlebox" class="xref">Appendix D.4</a>), this field MUST be non-empty, so a client not offering a pre&#8209;TLS&#160;1.3 session MUST generate a new 32-byte value. This value need not be random but SHOULD be unpredictable to avoid implementations fixating on a specific value (also known as ossification).  Otherwise, it MUST be set as a zero-length vector (i.e., a zero-valued single byte length field).</dd>
<dt>cipher_suites:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A list of the symmetric cipher options supported by the client, specifically the record protection algorithm (including secret key length) and a hash to be used with HKDF, in descending order of client preference.  Values are defined in <a href="#cipher-suites" class="xref">Appendix B.4</a>.  If the list contains cipher suites that the server does not recognize, support, or wish to use, the server MUST ignore those cipher suites and process the remaining ones as usual. If the client is attempting a PSK key establishment, it SHOULD advertise at least one cipher suite indicating a Hash associated with the PSK.</dd>
<dt>legacy_compression_methods:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Versions of TLS before 1.3 supported compression with the list of supported compression methods being sent in this field. For every TLS 1.3 ClientHello, this vector MUST contain exactly one byte, set to zero, which corresponds to the "null" compression method in prior versions of TLS. If a TLS&#160;1.3 ClientHello is received with any other value in this field, the server MUST abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert. Note that TLS 1.3 servers might receive TLS 1.2 or prior ClientHellos which contain other compression methods and (if negotiating such a prior version) MUST follow the procedures for the appropriate prior version of TLS.</dd>
<dt>extensions:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Clients request extended functionality from servers by sending data in the extensions field.  The actual "Extension" format is defined in <a href="#extensions" class="xref">Section 4.2</a>.  In TLS 1.3, the use of certain extensions is mandatory, as functionality has moved into extensions to preserve ClientHello compatibility with previous versions of TLS.  Servers MUST ignore unrecognized extensions.</dd>
</dl>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.7">All versions of TLS allow an extensions field to optionally follow the compression_methods field. TLS 1.3 ClientHello messages always contain extensions (minimally "supported_versions", otherwise, they will be interpreted as TLS 1.2 ClientHello messages).  However, TLS&#160;1.3 servers might receive ClientHello messages without an extensions field from prior versions of TLS.  The presence of extensions can be detected by determining whether there are bytes following the compression_methods field at the end of the ClientHello. Note that this method of detecting optional data differs from the normal TLS method of having a variable-length field, but it is used for compatibility with TLS before extensions were defined.  TLS 1.3 servers will need to perform this check first and only attempt to negotiate TLS 1.3 if the "supported_versions" extension is present.  If negotiating a version of TLS prior to 1.3, a server MUST check that the message either contains no data after legacy_compression_methods or that it contains a valid extensions block with no data following.  If not, then it MUST abort the handshake with a "decode_error" alert.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.8">In the event that a client requests additional functionality using extensions and this functionality is not supplied by the server, the client MAY abort the handshake.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.8">When multiple extensions of different types are present, the extensions MAY appear in any order, with the exception of "pre_shared_key" (<a href="#pre-shared-key-extension" class="xref">Section 4.2.11</a>) which MUST be the last extension in the ClientHello (but can appear anywhere in the ServerHello extensions block).  There MUST NOT be more than one extension of the same type in a given extension block.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.9">In TLS 1.3, unlike TLS 1.2, extensions are negotiated for each handshake even when in resumption-PSK mode. However, 0-RTT parameters are those negotiated in the previous handshake; mismatches may require rejecting 0-RTT (see <a href="#early-data-indication" class="xref">Section 4.2.10</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.10">There are subtle (and not so subtle) interactions that may occur in this protocol between new features and existing features which may result in a significant reduction in overall security. The following considerations should be taken into account when designing new extensions:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Some cases where a server does not agree to an extension are error conditions (e.g., the handshake cannot continue), and some are simply refusals to support particular features. In general, error alerts should be used for the former and a field in the server extension response for the latter.</li>
<li>Extensions should, as far as possible, be designed to prevent any attack that forces use (or non-use) of a particular feature by manipulation of handshake messages. This principle should be followed regardless of whether the feature is believed to cause a security problem.  Often the fact that the extension fields are included in the inputs to the Finished message hashes will be sufficient, but extreme care is needed when the extension changes the meaning of messages sent in the handshake phase.  Designers and implementors should be aware of the fact that until the handshake has been authenticated, active attackers can modify messages and insert, remove, or replace extensions.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.1">The "supported_versions" extension is used by the client to indicate which versions of TLS it supports and by the server to indicate which version it is using. The extension contains a list of supported versions in preference order, with the most preferred version first. Implementations of this specification MUST send this extension in the ClientHello containing all versions of TLS which they are prepared to negotiate (for this specification, that means minimally 0x0304, but if previous versions of TLS are allowed to be negotiated, they MUST be present as well).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.2">If this extension is not present, servers which are compliant with this specification and which also support TLS 1.2 MUST negotiate TLS&#160;1.2 or prior as specified in <a href="#RFC5246" class="xref">[RFC5246]</a>, even if ClientHello.legacy_version is 0x0304 or later.

Servers MUST only select a version of TLS present in that extension and MUST ignore any unknown versions that are present in that extension. Note that this mechanism makes it possible to negotiate a version prior to TLS 1.2 if one side supports a sparse range. Implementations of TLS 1.3 which choose to support prior versions of TLS SHOULD support TLS 1.2.  Servers MUST be prepared to receive ClientHellos that include this extension but do not include 0x0304 in the list of versions.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.4">A server which negotiates a version of TLS prior to TLS 1.3 MUST set ServerHello.version and MUST NOT send the "supported_versions" extension.

It MUST set the ServerHello.legacy_version field to 0x0303 (TLS 1.2). Clients MUST check for this extension prior to processing the rest of the ServerHello (although they will have to parse the ServerHello in order to read the extension).  If this extension is present, clients MUST ignore the ServerHello.legacy_version value and MUST use only the "supported_versions" extension to determine the selected version.

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Allowing the server to force the client to demonstrate reachability at their apparent network address (thus providing a measure of DoS protection). This is primarily useful for non&#8209;connection-oriented transports (see <a href="#RFC6347" class="xref">[RFC6347]</a> for an example of this).</li>
<li>Allowing the server to offload state to the client, thus allowing it to send a HelloRetryRequest without storing any state. The server can do this by storing the hash of the ClientHello in the HelloRetryRequest cookie (protected with some suitable integrity protection algorithm).</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.3">When sending a HelloRetryRequest, the server MAY provide a "cookie" extension to the client (this is an exception to the usual rule that the only extensions that may be sent are those that appear in the ClientHello). When sending the new ClientHello, the client MUST copy the contents of the extension received in the HelloRetryRequest into a "cookie" extension in the new ClientHello.  Clients MUST NOT use cookies in their initial ClientHello in subsequent connections.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.4">When a server is operating statelessly, it may receive an unprotected record of type change_cipher_spec between the first and second ClientHello (see <a href="#record-protocol" class="xref">Section 5</a>). Since the server is not storing any state, this will appear as if it were the first message to be received. Servers operating statelessly MUST ignore these records.</p>

The keys found in certificates MUST also be of appropriate type for the signature algorithms they are used with. This is a particular issue for RSA keys and PSS signatures, as described below. If no "signature_algorithms_cert" extension is present, then the "signature_algorithms" extension also applies to signatures appearing in certificates. Clients which desire the server to authenticate itself via a certificate MUST send the "signature_algorithms" extension. If a server is authenticating via a certificate and the client has not sent a "signature_algorithms" extension, then the server MUST abort the handshake with a "missing_extension" alert (see <a href="#mti-extensions" class="xref">Section 9.2</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.3.p.2">The "signature_algorithms_cert" extension was added to allow implementations which supported different sets of algorithms for certificates and in TLS itself to clearly signal their capabilities.

For each extension OID recognized by the client, all of the specified values MUST be present in the client certificate (but the certificate MAY have other values as well). However, the client MUST ignore and skip any unrecognized certificate extension OIDs. If the client ignored some of the required certificate extension OIDs and supplied a certificate that does not satisfy the request, the server MAY at its discretion either continue the connection without client authentication or abort the handshake with an "unsupported_certificate" alert. Any given OID MUST NOT appear more than once in the filters list.</dd>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Ignore the extension and return a regular 1-RTT response.  The server then skips past early data by attempting to deprotect received records using the handshake traffic key, discarding records which fail deprotection (up to the configured max_early_data_size).  Once a record is deprotected successfully, it is treated as the start of the client's second flight and the server proceeds as with an ordinary 1-RTT handshake.</li>
<li>Request that the client send another ClientHello by responding with a HelloRetryRequest.  A client MUST NOT include the "early_data" extension in its followup ClientHello.  The server then ignores early data by skipping all records with an external content type of "application_data" (indicating that they are encrypted), up to the configured max_early_data_size.</li>
<li>Return its own "early_data" extension in EncryptedExtensions, indicating that it intends to process the early data. It is not possible for the server to accept only a subset of the early data messages.  Even though the server sends a message accepting early data, the actual early data itself may already be in flight by the time the server generates this message.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.10.p.9">In order to accept early data, the server MUST have accepted a PSK cipher suite and selected the first key offered in the client's "pre_shared_key" extension. In addition, it MUST verify that the following values are the same as those associated with the selected&#160;PSK:</p>
<p></p>

<li>The TLS version number</li>
<li>The selected cipher suite</li>

For externally established PSKs, the associated values are those provisioned along with the key.  For PSKs established via a NewSessionTicket message, the associated values are those negotiated in the connection during which the ticket was established.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.10.p.12">Future extensions MUST define their interaction with 0-RTT.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.10.p.13">If any of these checks fail, the server MUST NOT respond with the extension and must discard all the first-flight data using one of the first two mechanisms listed above (thus falling back to 1-RTT or 2-RTT). If the client attempts a 0-RTT handshake but the server rejects it, the server will generally not have the 0-RTT record protection keys and must instead use trial decryption (either with the 1-RTT handshake keys or by looking for a cleartext ClientHello in the case of a HelloRetryRequest) to find the first non-0-RTT message.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.10.p.14">If the server chooses to accept the "early_data" extension, then it MUST comply with the same error-handling requirements specified for all records when processing early data records.  Specifically, if the server fails to decrypt a 0-RTT record following an accepted "early_data" extension, it MUST terminate the connection with a "bad_record_mac" alert as per <a href="#record-payload-protection" class="xref">Section 5.2</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.10.p.15">If the server rejects the "early_data" extension, the client application MAY opt to retransmit the Application Data previously sent in early data once the handshake has been completed.  Note that automatic retransmission of early data could result in incorrect assumptions regarding the status of the connection. For instance, when the negotiated connection selects a different ALPN protocol from what was used for the early data, an application might need to construct different messages.  Similarly, if early data assumes anything about the connection state, it might be sent in error after the handshake completes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.10.p.16">A TLS implementation SHOULD NOT automatically resend early data; applications are in a better position to decide when retransmission is appropriate.

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.11.p.5">In TLS versions prior to TLS 1.3, the Server Name Identification (SNI) value was intended to be associated with the session (Section&#160;3 of <a href="#RFC6066" class="xref">[RFC6066]</a>), with the server being required to enforce that the SNI value associated with the session matches the one specified in the resumption handshake.  However, in reality the implementations were not consistent on which of two supplied SNI values they would use, leading to the consistency requirement being de&#160;facto enforced by the clients.  In TLS 1.3, the SNI value is always explicitly specified in the resumption handshake, and there is no need for the server to associate an SNI value with the ticket. Clients, however, SHOULD store the SNI with the PSK to fulfill the requirements of <a href="#NSTMessage" class="xref">Section 4.6.1</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.11.p.6">Implementor's note: When session resumption is the primary use case of PSKs, the most straightforward way to implement the PSK/cipher suite matching requirements is to negotiate the cipher suite first and then exclude any incompatible PSKs. Any unknown PSKs (e.g., ones not in the PSK database or encrypted with an unknown key) SHOULD simply be ignored. If no acceptable PSKs are found, the server SHOULD perform a non-PSK handshake if possible.  If backward compatibility is important, client-provided, externally established PSKs SHOULD influence cipher suite selection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.11.p.7">Prior to accepting PSK key establishment, the server MUST validate the corresponding binder value (see <a href="#psk-binder" class="xref">Section 4.2.11.2</a> below). If this value is not present or does not validate, the server MUST abort the handshake.  Servers SHOULD NOT attempt to validate multiple binders; rather, they SHOULD select a single PSK and validate solely the binder that corresponds to that PSK.  See <a href="#client-hello-recording" class="xref">Section 8.2</a> and <a href="#psk-identity-exposure" class="xref">Appendix E.6</a> for the security rationale for this requirement.  In order to accept PSK key establishment, the server sends a "pre_shared_key" extension indicating the selected identity.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.11.p.8">Clients MUST verify that the server's selected_identity is within the range supplied by the client, that the server selected a cipher suite indicating a Hash associated with the PSK, and that a server "key_share" extension is present if required by the ClientHello "psk_key_exchange_modes" extension. If these values are not consistent, the client MUST abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.11.p.9">If the server supplies an "early_data" extension, the client MUST verify that the server's selected_identity is 0. If any other value is returned, the client MUST abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.11.p.10">The "pre_shared_key" extension MUST be the last extension in the ClientHello (this facilitates implementation as described below). Servers MUST check that it is the last extension and otherwise fail the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.</p>

Clients MUST NOT attempt to use tickets which have ages greater than the "ticket_lifetime" value which was provided with the ticket. The "obfuscated_ticket_age" field of each PskIdentity contains an obfuscated version of the ticket age formed by taking the age in milliseconds and adding the "ticket_age_add" value that was included with the ticket (see <a href="#NSTMessage" class="xref">Section 4.6.1</a>), modulo 2^32. This addition prevents passive observers from correlating connections unless tickets are reused. Note that the "ticket_lifetime" field in the NewSessionTicket message is in seconds but the "obfuscated_ticket_age" is in milliseconds. Because ticket lifetimes are restricted to a week, 32 bits is enough to represent any plausible age, even in milliseconds.</p>

Each entry in the binders list is computed as an HMAC over a transcript hash (see <a href="#the-transcript-hash" class="xref">Section 4.4.1</a>) containing a partial ClientHello up to and including the PreSharedKeyExtension.identities field. That is, it includes all of the ClientHello but not the binders list itself. The length fields for the message (including the overall length, the length of the extensions block, and the length of the "pre_shared_key" extension) are all set as if binders of the correct lengths were present.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.11.2.p.2">The PskBinderEntry is computed in the same way as the Finished message (<a href="#finished" class="xref">Section 4.4.4</a>) but with the BaseKey being the binder_key derived via the key schedule from the corresponding PSK which is being offered (see <a href="#key-schedule" class="xref">Section 7.1</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.11.2.p.3">If the handshake includes a HelloRetryRequest, the initial ClientHello and HelloRetryRequest are included in the transcript along with the new ClientHello.  For instance, if the client sends ClientHello1, its binder will be computed over:</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.4.1.p.3">The reason for this construction is to allow the server to do a stateless HelloRetryRequest by storing just the hash of ClientHello1 in the cookie, rather than requiring it to export the entire intermediate hash state (see <a href="#cookie" class="xref">Section 4.2.2</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.1.p.4">For concreteness, the transcript hash is always taken from the following sequence of handshake messages, starting at the first ClientHello and including only those messages that were sent: ClientHello, HelloRetryRequest, ClientHello, ServerHello, EncryptedExtensions, server CertificateRequest, server Certificate, server CertificateVerify, server Finished, EndOfEarlyData, client Certificate, client CertificateVerify, client Finished.</p>

Also, if some aspect of the certificate chain was unacceptable (e.g., it was not signed by a known, trusted CA), the server MAY at its discretion either continue the handshake (considering the client unauthenticated) or abort the handshake.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.2.4.p.4">Any endpoint receiving any certificate which it would need to validate using any signature algorithm using an MD5 hash MUST abort the handshake with a "bad_certificate" alert.  SHA-1 is deprecated, and it is RECOMMENDED that any endpoint receiving any certificate which it would need to validate using any signature algorithm using a SHA-1 hash abort the handshake with a "bad_certificate" alert.

<p id="rfc.section.4.4.3.p.6">This structure is intended to prevent an attack on previous versions of TLS in which the ServerKeyExchange format meant that attackers could obtain a signature of a message with a chosen 32-byte prefix (ClientHello.random).

<p id="rfc.section.4.6.1.p.1">At any time after the server has received the client Finished message, it MAY send a NewSessionTicket message. This message creates a unique association between the ticket value and a secret PSK derived from the resumption master secret (see <a href="#cryptographic-computations" class="xref">Section 7</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.1.p.2">The client MAY use this PSK for future handshakes by including the ticket value in the "pre_shared_key" extension in its ClientHello (<a href="#pre-shared-key-extension" class="xref">Section 4.2.11</a>). Servers MAY send multiple tickets on a single connection, either immediately after each other or after specific events (see <a href="#client-tracking" class="xref">Appendix C.4</a>).  For instance, the server might send a new ticket after post-handshake authentication in order to encapsulate the additional client authentication state. Multiple tickets are useful for clients for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Opening multiple parallel HTTP connections.</li>
<li>Performing connection racing across interfaces and address families via (for example) Happy Eyeballs <a href="#RFC8305" class="xref">[RFC8305]</a> or related techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.1.p.4">Any ticket MUST only be resumed with a cipher suite that has the same KDF hash algorithm as that used to establish the original connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.1.p.5">Clients MUST only resume if the new SNI value is valid for the server certificate presented in the original session and SHOULD only resume if the SNI value matches the one used in the original session.  The latter is a performance optimization: normally, there is no reason to expect that different servers covered by a single certificate would be able to accept each other's tickets; hence, attempting resumption in that case would waste a single-use ticket.  If such an indication is provided (externally or by any other means), clients MAY resume with a different SNI value.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.1.p.6">On resumption, if reporting an SNI value to the calling application, implementations MUST use the value sent in the resumption ClientHello rather than the value sent in the previous session. Note that if a server implementation declines all PSK identities with different SNI values, these two values are always the same.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.6.1.p.7">Note: Although the resumption master secret depends on the client's second flight, a server which does not request client authentication MAY compute the remainder of the transcript independently and then send a NewSessionTicket immediately upon sending its Finished rather than waiting for the client Finished.  This might be appropriate in cases where the client is expected to open multiple TLS connections in parallel and would benefit from the reduced overhead of a resumption handshake, for example.</p>

Note that implementations may receive an arbitrary number of messages between sending a KeyUpdate with request_update set to "update_requested" and receiving the peer's KeyUpdate, because those messages may already be in flight.

In order to maximize backward compatibility, a record containing an initial ClientHello SHOULD have version 0x0301 (reflecting TLS 1.0) and a record containing a second ClientHello or a ServerHello MUST have version 0x0303 (reflecting TLS&#160;1.2).

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.1">All encrypted TLS records can be padded to inflate the size of the TLSCiphertext.  This allows the sender to hide the size of the traffic from an observer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.2">When generating a TLSCiphertext record, implementations MAY choose to pad.  An unpadded record is just a record with a padding length of zero.  Padding is a string of zero-valued bytes appended to the ContentType field before encryption.  Implementations MUST set the padding octets to all zeros before encrypting.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.3">Application Data records may contain a zero-length TLSInnerPlaintext.content if the sender desires.  This permits generation of plausibly sized cover traffic in contexts where the presence or absence of activity may be sensitive.  Implementations MUST NOT send Handshake and Alert records that have a zero-length TLSInnerPlaintext.content; if such a message is received, the receiving implementation MUST terminate the connection with an "unexpected_message" alert.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.4">The padding sent is automatically verified by the record protection mechanism; upon successful decryption of a TLSCiphertext.encrypted_record, the receiving implementation scans the field from the end toward the beginning until it finds a non-zero octet. This non-zero octet is the content type of the message.  This padding scheme was selected because it allows padding of any encrypted TLS record by an arbitrary size (from zero up to TLS record size limits) without introducing new content types.  The design also enforces all-zero padding octets, which allows for quick detection of padding errors.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.5">Implementations MUST limit their scanning to the cleartext returned from the AEAD decryption.  If a receiving implementation does not find a non-zero octet in the cleartext, it MUST terminate the connection with an "unexpected_message" alert.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.6">The presence of padding does not change the overall record size limitations: the full encoded TLSInnerPlaintext MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 1 octets. If the maximum fragment length is reduced -- as, for example, by the record_size_limit extension from <a href="#TLS-Record-Limit" class="xref">[TLS-Record-Limit]</a> -- then the reduced limit applies to the full plaintext, including the content type and padding.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.7">Selecting a padding policy that suggests when and how much to pad is a complex topic and is beyond the scope of this specification. If the application-layer protocol on top of TLS has its own padding, it may be preferable to pad Application Data TLS records within the application layer.  Padding for encrypted Handshake or Alert records must still be handled at the TLS layer, though.  Later documents may define padding selection algorithms or define a padding policy request mechanism through TLS extensions or some other means.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.2">For AES-GCM, up to 2^24.5 full-size records (about 24 million) may be encrypted on a given connection while keeping a safety margin of approximately 2^-57 for Authenticated Encryption (AE) security.

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">Alert messages convey a description of the alert and a legacy field that conveyed the severity level of the message in previous versions of TLS. Alerts are divided into two classes: closure alerts and error alerts.  In TLS 1.3, the severity is implicit in the type of alert being sent, and the "level" field can safely be ignored. The "close_notify" alert is used to indicate orderly closure of one direction of the connection.  Upon receiving such an alert, the TLS implementation SHOULD indicate end-of-data to the application.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.3">Error alerts indicate abortive closure of the connection (see <a href="#error-alerts" class="xref">Section 6.2</a>). Upon receiving an error alert, the TLS implementation SHOULD indicate an error to the application and MUST NOT allow any further data to be sent or received on the connection.

For the computation of the binder_key, the label is "ext binder" for external PSKs (those provisioned outside of TLS) and "res binder" for resumption PSKs (those provisioned as the resumption master secret of a previous handshake).

<a href="#rfc.section.8">8.</a> <a href="#anti-replay" id="anti-replay">0-RTT and Anti-Replay</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">As noted in <a href="#zero-rtt-data" class="xref">Section 2.3</a> and <a href="#replay-0rtt" class="xref">Appendix E.5</a>, TLS does not provide inherent replay protections for 0-RTT data. There are two potential threats to be concerned with:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Network attackers who mount a replay attack by simply duplicating a flight of 0-RTT data.</li>
<li>Network attackers who take advantage of client retry behavior to arrange for the server to receive multiple copies of an application message. This threat already exists to some extent because clients that value robustness respond to network errors by attempting to retry requests. However, 0-RTT adds an additional dimension for any server system which does not maintain globally consistent server state. Specifically, if a server system has multiple zones where tickets from zone A will not be accepted in zone B, then an attacker can duplicate a ClientHello and early data intended for A to both A and B. At A, the data will be accepted in 0-RTT, but at B the server will reject 0-RTT data and instead force a full handshake. If the attacker blocks the ServerHello from A, then the client will complete the handshake with B and probably retry the request, leading to duplication on the server system as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.3">The first class of attack can be prevented by sharing state to guarantee that the 0-RTT data is accepted at most once.  Servers SHOULD provide that level of replay safety by implementing one of the methods described in this section or by equivalent means.  It is understood, however, that due to operational concerns not all deployments will maintain state at that level.  Therefore, in normal operation, clients will not know which, if any, of these mechanisms servers actually implement and hence MUST only send early data which they deem safe to be replayed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.4">In addition to the direct effects of replays, there is a class of attacks where even operations normally considered idempotent could be exploited by a large number of replays (timing attacks, resource limit exhaustion and others, as described in <a href="#replay-0rtt" class="xref">Appendix E.5</a>).  Those can be mitigated by ensuring that every 0-RTT payload can be replayed only a limited number of times.  The server MUST ensure that any instance of it (be it a machine, a thread, or any other entity within the relevant serving infrastructure) would accept 0-RTT for the same 0-RTT handshake at most once; this limits the number of replays to the number of server instances in the deployment.  Such a guarantee can be accomplished by locally recording data from recently received ClientHellos and rejecting repeats, or by any other method that provides the same or a stronger guarantee.  The "at most once per server instance" guarantee is a minimum requirement; servers SHOULD limit 0-RTT replays further when feasible.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.5">The second class of attack cannot be prevented at the TLS layer and MUST be dealt with by any application. Note that any application whose clients implement any kind of retry behavior already needs to implement some sort of anti-replay defense.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.8.1">8.1.</a> <a href="#single-use-tickets" id="single-use-tickets">Single-Use Tickets</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.1">The simplest form of anti-replay defense is for the server to only allow each session ticket to be used once. For instance, the server can maintain a database of all outstanding valid tickets, deleting each ticket from the database as it is used. If an unknown ticket is provided, the server would then fall back to a full handshake.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.2">If the tickets are not self-contained but rather are database keys, and the corresponding PSKs are deleted upon use, then connections established using PSKs enjoy forward secrecy. This improves security for all 0-RTT data and PSK usage when PSK is used without (EC)DHE.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.3">Because this mechanism requires sharing the session database between server nodes in environments with multiple distributed servers, it may be hard to achieve high rates of successful PSK 0-RTT connections when compared to self-encrypted tickets. Unlike session databases, session tickets can successfully do PSK-based session establishment even without consistent storage, though when 0-RTT is allowed they still require consistent storage for anti-replay of 0-RTT data, as detailed in the following section.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.8.2">8.2.</a> <a href="#client-hello-recording" id="client-hello-recording">Client Hello Recording</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.1">An alternative form of anti-replay is to record a unique value derived from the ClientHello (generally either the random value or the PSK binder) and reject duplicates. Recording all ClientHellos causes state to grow without bound, but a server can instead record ClientHellos within a given time window and use the "obfuscated_ticket_age" to ensure that tickets aren't reused outside that window.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.2">In order to implement this, when a ClientHello is received, the server first verifies the PSK binder as described in <a href="#pre-shared-key-extension" class="xref">Section 4.2.11</a>. It then computes the expected_arrival_time as described in the next section and rejects 0-RTT if it is outside the recording window, falling back to the 1-RTT handshake.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.3">If the expected_arrival_time is in the window, then the server checks to see if it has recorded a matching ClientHello. If one is found, it either aborts the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert or accepts the PSK but rejects 0-RTT. If no matching ClientHello is found, then it accepts 0-RTT and then stores the ClientHello for as long as the expected_arrival_time is inside the window.  Servers MAY also implement data stores with false positives, such as Bloom filters, in which case they MUST respond to apparent replay by rejecting 0-RTT but MUST NOT abort the handshake.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.4">The server MUST derive the storage key only from validated sections of the ClientHello. If the ClientHello contains multiple PSK identities, then an attacker can create multiple ClientHellos with different binder values for the less-preferred identity on the assumption that the server will not verify it (as recommended by <a href="#pre-shared-key-extension" class="xref">Section 4.2.11</a>). I.e., if the client sends PSKs A and B but the server prefers A, then the attacker can change the binder for B without affecting the binder for A. If the binder for B is part of the storage key, then this ClientHello will not appear as a duplicate, which will cause the ClientHello to be accepted, and may cause side effects such as replay cache pollution, although any 0-RTT data will not be decryptable because it will use different keys. If the validated binder or the ClientHello.random is used as the storage key, then this attack is not possible.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.5">Because this mechanism does not require storing all outstanding tickets, it may be easier to implement in distributed systems with high rates of resumption and 0-RTT, at the cost of potentially weaker anti-replay defense because of the difficulty of reliably storing and retrieving the received ClientHello messages.  In many such systems, it is impractical to have globally consistent storage of all the received ClientHellos.  In this case, the best anti-replay protection is provided by having a single storage zone be authoritative for a given ticket and refusing 0-RTT for that ticket in any other zone. This approach prevents simple replay by the attacker because only one zone will accept 0-RTT data. A weaker design is to implement separate storage for each zone but allow 0-RTT in any zone. This approach limits the number of replays to once per zone. Application message duplication of course remains possible with either design.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.6">When implementations are freshly started, they SHOULD reject 0-RTT as long as any portion of their recording window overlaps the startup time. Otherwise, they run the risk of accepting replays which were originally sent during that period.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.7">Note: If the client's clock is running much faster than the server's, then a ClientHello may be received that is outside the window in the future, in which case it might be accepted for 1-RTT, causing a client retry, and then acceptable later for 0-RTT. This is another variant of the second form of attack described in <a href="#anti-replay" class="xref">Section 8</a>.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.8.3">8.3.</a> <a href="#freshness-checks" id="freshness-checks">Freshness Checks</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.3.p.1">Because the ClientHello indicates the time at which the client sent it, it is possible to efficiently determine whether a ClientHello was likely sent reasonably recently and only accept 0-RTT for such a ClientHello, otherwise falling back to a 1-RTT handshake.  This is necessary for the ClientHello storage mechanism described in <a href="#client-hello-recording" class="xref">Section 8.2</a> because otherwise the server needs to store an unlimited number of ClientHellos, and is a useful optimization for self-contained single-use tickets because it allows efficient rejection of ClientHellos which cannot be used for 0-RTT.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.3.p.2">In order to implement this mechanism, a server needs to store the time that the server generated the session ticket, offset by an estimate of the round-trip time between client and server. I.e.,</p>
<pre>
    adjusted_creation_time = creation_time + estimated_RTT
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.8.3.p.3">This value can be encoded in the ticket, thus avoiding the need to keep state for each outstanding ticket. The server can determine the client's view of the age of the ticket by subtracting the ticket's "ticket_age_add" value from the "obfuscated_ticket_age" parameter in the client's "pre_shared_key" extension. The server can determine the expected_arrival_time of the ClientHello as:</p>
<pre>
    expected_arrival_time = adjusted_creation_time + clients_ticket_age
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.8.3.p.4">When a new ClientHello is received, the expected_arrival_time is then compared against the current server wall clock time and if they differ by more than a certain amount, 0-RTT is rejected, though the 1-RTT handshake can be allowed to complete.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.3.p.5">There are several potential sources of error that might cause mismatches between the expected_arrival_time and the measured time. Variations in client and server clock rates are likely to be minimal, though potentially the absolute times may be off by large values.  Network propagation delays are the most likely causes of a mismatch in legitimate values for elapsed time.  Both the NewSessionTicket and ClientHello messages might be retransmitted and therefore delayed, which might be hidden by TCP. For clients on the Internet, this implies windows on the order of ten seconds to account for errors in clocks and variations in measurements; other deployment scenarios may have different needs. Clock skew distributions are not symmetric, so the optimal tradeoff may involve an asymmetric range of permissible mismatch values.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.3.p.6">Note that freshness checking alone is not sufficient to prevent replays because it does not detect them during the error window, which -- depending on bandwidth and system capacity -- could include billions of replays in real-world settings. In addition, this freshness checking is only done at the time the ClientHello is received and not when subsequent early Application Data records are received. After early data is accepted, records may continue to be streamed to the server over a longer time period.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.1">This section describes invariants that TLS endpoints and middleboxes MUST follow. It also applies to earlier versions of TLS.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.2">TLS is designed to be securely and compatibly extensible. Newer clients or servers, when communicating with newer peers, should negotiate the most preferred common parameters. The TLS handshake provides downgrade protection: Middleboxes passing traffic between a newer client and newer server without terminating TLS should be unable to influence the handshake (see <a href="#security-handshake" class="xref">Appendix E.1</a>). At the same time, deployments update at different rates, so a newer client or server MAY continue to support older parameters, which would allow it to interoperate with older endpoints.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.3">For this to work, implementations MUST correctly handle extensible fields:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>A client sending a ClientHello MUST support all parameters advertised in it. Otherwise, the server may fail to interoperate by selecting one of those parameters.</li>
<li>A server receiving a ClientHello MUST correctly ignore all unrecognized cipher suites, extensions, and other parameters. Otherwise, it may fail to interoperate with newer clients. In TLS&#160;1.3, a client receiving a CertificateRequest or NewSessionTicket MUST also ignore all unrecognized extensions.</li>
<li>A middlebox which terminates a TLS connection MUST behave as a compliant TLS server (to the original client), including having a certificate which the client is willing to accept, and also as a compliant TLS client (to the original server), including verifying the original server's certificate.  In particular, it MUST generate its own ClientHello containing only parameters it understands, and it MUST generate a fresh ServerHello random value, rather than forwarding the endpoint's value.  <br><br> Note that TLS's protocol requirements and security analysis only apply to the two connections separately. Safely deploying a TLS terminator requires additional security considerations which are beyond the scope of this document.</li>
<li>A middlebox which forwards ClientHello parameters it does not understand MUST NOT process any messages beyond that ClientHello. It MUST forward all subsequent traffic unmodified. Otherwise, it may fail to interoperate with newer clients and servers.  <br><br> Forwarded ClientHellos may contain advertisements for features not supported by the middlebox, so the response may include future TLS additions the middlebox does not recognize. These additions MAY change any message beyond the ClientHello arbitrarily. In particular, the values sent in the ServerHello might change, the ServerHello format might change, and the TLSCiphertext format might change.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.9.3.p.5">The design of TLS 1.3 was constrained by widely deployed non&#8209;compliant TLS middleboxes (see <a href="#middlebox" class="xref">Appendix D.4</a>); however, it does not relax the invariants. Those middleboxes continue to be non&#8209;compliant.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.11.p.1">This document uses several registries that were originally created in <a href="#RFC4346" class="xref">[RFC4346]</a> and updated in <a href="#RFC8447" class="xref">[RFC8447]</a>.  IANA has updated these to reference this document.  The registries and their allocation policies are below:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>TLS Cipher Suites registry: values with the first byte in the range 0-254 (decimal) are assigned via Specification Required <a href="#RFC8126" class="xref">[RFC8126]</a>. Values with the first byte 255 (decimal) are reserved for Private Use <a href="#RFC8126" class="xref">[RFC8126]</a>.  <br><br> IANA has added the cipher suites listed in <a href="#cipher-suites" class="xref">Appendix B.4</a> to the registry. The "Value" and "Description" columns are taken from the table.  The "DTLS-OK" and "Recommended" columns are both marked as "Y" for each new cipher suite.</li>
<li>TLS ContentType registry: Future values are allocated via Standards Action <a href="#RFC8126" class="xref">[RFC8126]</a>.</li>
<li>TLS Alerts registry: Future values are allocated via Standards Action <a href="#RFC8126" class="xref">[RFC8126]</a>. IANA has populated this registry with the values from <a href="#alert-messages" class="xref">Appendix B.2</a>.  The "DTLS-OK" column is marked as "Y" for all such values.  Values marked as "_RESERVED" have comments describing their previous usage.</li>
<li>TLS HandshakeType registry: Future values are allocated via Standards Action <a href="#RFC8126" class="xref">[RFC8126]</a>. IANA has updated this registry to rename item 4 from "NewSessionTicket" to "new_session_ticket" and populated this registry with the values from <a href="#handshake-protocol-1" class="xref">Appendix B.3</a>.  The "DTLS-OK" column is marked as "Y" for all such values.  Values marked "RESERVED" have comments describing their previous or temporary usage.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.3">This document also uses the TLS ExtensionType Values registry originally created in <a href="#RFC4366" class="xref">[RFC4366]</a>. IANA has updated it to reference this document.  Changes to the registry follow:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>IANA has updated the registration policy as follows: <br><br> Values with the first byte in the range 0-254 (decimal) are assigned via Specification Required <a href="#RFC8126" class="xref">[RFC8126]</a>.  Values with the first byte 255 (decimal) are reserved for Private Use <a href="#RFC8126" class="xref">[RFC8126]</a>.</li>
<li>IANA has updated this registry to include the "key_share", "pre_shared_key", "psk_key_exchange_modes", "early_data", "cookie", "supported_versions", "certificate_authorities", "oid_filters", "post_handshake_auth", and "signature_algorithms_cert" extensions with the values defined in this document and the "Recommended" value of "Y".</li>
<li>IANA has updated this registry to include a "TLS&#160;1.3" column which lists the messages in which the extension may appear. This column has been initially populated from the table in <a href="#extensions" class="xref">Section 4.2</a>, with any extension not listed there marked as "-" to indicate that it is not used by TLS 1.3.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.11.p.5">This document updates an entry in the TLS Certificate Types registry originally created in <a href="#RFC6091" class="xref">[RFC6091]</a> and updated in <a href="#RFC8447" class="xref">[RFC8447]</a>.

Values with the first byte in the range 0-6 or with the second byte in the range 0-3 that are not currently allocated are reserved for backward compatibility.  This registry has a "Recommended" column.  The registry has been initially populated with the values described in <a href="#signature-algorithms" class="xref">Section 4.2.3</a>.

The "Recommended" column is assigned a value of "N" unless explicitly requested, and adding a value with a "Recommended" value of "Y" requires Standards Action <a href="#RFC8126" class="xref">[RFC8126]</a>.</li>
<li>TLS PskKeyExchangeMode registry: Values in the range 0-253 (decimal) are assigned via Specification Required <a href="#RFC8126" class="xref">[RFC8126]</a>.  The values 254 and 255 (decimal) are reserved for Private Use <a href="#RFC8126" class="xref">[RFC8126]</a>.  This registry has a "Recommended" column.  The registry has been initially populated with psk_ke (0) and psk_dhe_ke (1).  Both are marked as "Recommended".  The "Recommended" column is assigned a value of "N" unless explicitly requested, and adding a value with a "Recommended" value of "Y" requires Standards Action <a href="#RFC8126" class="xref">[RFC8126]</a>.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.A.p.1">This appendix provides a summary of the legal state transitions for the client and server handshakes.  State names (in all capitals, e.g., START) have no formal meaning but are provided for ease of comprehension.  Actions which are taken only in certain circumstances are indicated in []. The notation "K_{send,recv} = foo" means "set the send/recv key to the given key".</p>

In most cases, the operating system provides an appropriate facility such as /dev/urandom, which should be used absent other (e.g., performance) concerns.  It is RECOMMENDED to use an existing CSPRNG implementation in preference to crafting a new one. Many adequate cryptographic libraries are already available under favorable license terms.  Should those prove unsatisfactory, <a href="#RFC4086" class="xref">[RFC4086]</a> provides guidance on the generation of random values.</p>

With a properly functioning CSPRNG, this does not present a security problem, as it is not feasible to determine the CSPRNG state from its output. However, with a broken CSPRNG, it may be possible for an attacker to use the public output to determine the CSPRNG internal state and thereby predict the keying material, as documented in <a href="#CHECKOWAY" class="xref">[CHECKOWAY]</a>.

<p id="rfc.section.C.3.p.2">TLS protocol issues:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Do you correctly handle handshake messages that are fragmented to multiple TLS records (see <a href="#record-layer" class="xref">Section 5.1</a>)? Do you correctly handle corner cases like a ClientHello that is split into several small fragments? Do you fragment handshake messages that exceed the maximum fragment size? In particular, the Certificate and CertificateRequest handshake messages can be large enough to require fragmentation.</li>
<li>Do you ignore the TLS record layer version number in all unencrypted TLS records (see <a href="#backward-compatibility" class="xref">Appendix D</a>)?</li>
<li>Have you ensured that all support for SSL, RC4, EXPORT ciphers, and MD5 (via the "signature_algorithms" extension) is completely removed from all possible configurations that support TLS 1.3 or later, and that attempts to use these obsolete capabilities fail correctly (see <a href="#backward-compatibility" class="xref">Appendix D</a>)?</li>
<li>Do you handle TLS extensions in ClientHellos correctly, including unknown extensions?</li>
<li>When the server has requested a client certificate but no suitable certificate is available, do you correctly send an empty Certificate message, instead of omitting the whole message (see <a href="#certificate" class="xref">Section 4.4.2</a>)?</li>
<li>When processing the plaintext fragment produced by AEAD-Decrypt and scanning from the end for the ContentType, do you avoid scanning past the start of the cleartext in the event that the peer has sent a malformed plaintext of all zeros?</li>
<li>Do you properly ignore unrecognized cipher suites (<a href="#client-hello" class="xref">Section 4.1.2</a>), hello extensions (<a href="#extensions" class="xref">Section 4.2</a>), named groups (<a href="#negotiated-groups" class="xref">Section 4.2.7</a>), key shares (<a href="#key-share" class="xref">Section 4.2.8</a>), supported versions (<a href="#supported-versions" class="xref">Section 4.2.1</a>), and signature algorithms (<a href="#signature-algorithms" class="xref">Section 4.2.3</a>) in the ClientHello?</li>
<li>As a server, do you send a HelloRetryRequest to clients which support a compatible (EC)DHE group but do not predict it in the "key_share" extension? As a client, do you correctly handle a HelloRetryRequest from the server?</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>What countermeasures do you use to prevent timing attacks <a href="#TIMING" class="xref">[TIMING]</a>?</li>
<li>When using Diffie-Hellman key exchange, do you correctly preserve leading zero bytes in the negotiated key (see <a href="#finite-field-diffie-hellman" class="xref">Section 7.4.1</a>)?</li>
<li>Does your TLS client check that the Diffie-Hellman parameters sent by the server are acceptable (see <a href="#ffdhe-param" class="xref">Section 4.2.8.1</a>)?</li>
<li>Do you use a strong and, most importantly, properly seeded random number generator (see <a href="#random-number-generation-and-seeding" class="xref">Appendix C.1</a>) when generating Diffie-Hellman private values, the ECDSA "k" parameter, and other security-critical values? It is RECOMMENDED that implementations implement "deterministic ECDSA" as specified in <a href="#RFC6979" class="xref">[RFC6979]</a>.</li>
<li>Do you zero-pad Diffie-Hellman public key values and shared secrets to the group size (see <a href="#ffdhe-param" class="xref">Section 4.2.8.1</a> and <a href="#finite-field-diffie-hellman" class="xref">Section 7.4.1</a>)?</li>
<li>Do you verify signatures after making them, to protect against RSA&#8209;CRT key leaks <a href="#FW15" class="xref">[FW15]</a>?</li>

<ul>

<li>Using a public key contained in a certificate but without validation of the certificate chain or any of its contents.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.D.p.3">Prior versions of TLS used the record layer version number (TLSPlaintext.legacy_record_version and TLSCiphertext.legacy_record_version) for various purposes.  As of TLS&#160;1.3, this field is deprecated. The value of TLSPlaintext.legacy_record_version MUST be ignored by all implementations.  The value of TLSCiphertext.legacy_record_version is included in the additional data for deprotection but MAY otherwise be ignored or MAY be validated to match the fixed constant value.  Version negotiation is performed using only the handshake versions (ClientHello.legacy_version and ServerHello.legacy_version, as well as the ClientHello, HelloRetryRequest, and ServerHello "supported_versions" extensions). In order to maximize interoperability with older endpoints, implementations that negotiate the use of TLS 1.0-1.2 SHOULD set the record layer version number to the negotiated version for the ServerHello and all records thereafter.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.p.4">For maximum compatibility with previously non-standard behavior and misconfigured deployments, all implementations SHOULD support validation of certification paths based on the expectations in this document, even when handling prior TLS versions' handshakes (see <a href="#server-certificate-selection" class="xref">Section 4.4.2.2</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.p.5">TLS 1.2 and prior supported an "Extended Master Secret" <a href="#RFC7627" class="xref">[RFC7627]</a> extension which digested large parts of the handshake transcript into the master secret.  Because TLS 1.3 always hashes in the transcript up to the server Finished, implementations which support both TLS 1.3 and earlier versions SHOULD indicate the use of the Extended Master Secret extension in their APIs whenever TLS 1.3 is&#160;used.</p>

If the server does not support TLS 1.3, it will respond with a ServerHello containing an older version number. If the client agrees to use this version, the negotiation will proceed as appropriate for the negotiated protocol. A client using a ticket for resumption SHOULD initiate the connection using the version that was previously negotiated.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.1.p.2">Note that 0-RTT data is not compatible with older servers and SHOULD&#160;NOT be sent absent knowledge that the server supports TLS 1.3.  See <a href="#zero-rtt-backward-compatibility" class="xref">Appendix D.3</a>.</p>

If the "supported_versions" extension is not present, the server MUST negotiate the minimum of ClientHello.legacy_version and TLS 1.2.

An older server will respond to the ClientHello with an older ServerHello, but it will not correctly skip the 0-RTT data and will fail to complete the handshake. This can cause issues when a client attempts to use 0-RTT, particularly against multi-server deployments.

Implementations can increase the chance of making connections through those middleboxes by making the TLS 1.3 handshake look more like a TLS 1.2 handshake:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The client always provides a non-empty session ID in the ClientHello, as described in the legacy_session_id section of <a href="#client-hello" class="xref">Section 4.1.2</a>.</li>
<li>If not offering early data, the client sends a dummy change_cipher_spec record (see the third paragraph of <a href="#record-protocol" class="xref">Section 5</a>) immediately before its second flight. This may either be before its second ClientHello or before its encrypted handshake flight.  If offering early data, the record is placed immediately after the first ClientHello.</li>
<li>The server sends a dummy change_cipher_spec record immediately after its first handshake message. This may either be after a ServerHello or a HelloRetryRequest.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.D.4.p.3">When put together, these changes make the TLS 1.3 handshake resemble TLS 1.2 session resumption, which improves the chance of successfully connecting through middleboxes. This "compatibility mode" is partially negotiated: the client can opt to provide a session ID or not, and the server has to echo it. Either side can send change_cipher_spec at any time during the handshake, as they must be ignored by the peer, but if the client sends a non-empty session ID, the server MUST send the change_cipher_spec as described in this appendix.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.E.1.p.1">The TLS handshake is an Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocol which is intended to provide both one-way authenticated (server-only) and mutually authenticated (client and server) functionality. At the completion of the handshake, each side outputs its view of the following values:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>A set of "session keys" (the various secrets derived from the master secret) from which can be derived a set of working keys.</li>
<li>A set of cryptographic parameters (algorithms, etc.).</li>
<li>The identities of the communicating parties.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.E.1.p.3">We assume the attacker to be an active network attacker, which means it has complete control over the network used to communicate between the parties <a href="#RFC3552" class="xref">[RFC3552]</a>.  Even under these conditions, the handshake should provide the properties listed below.  Note that these properties are not necessarily independent, but reflect the protocol consumers' needs.</p>
<p></p>

<dl>
<dt>Establishing the same session keys:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The handshake needs to output the same set of session keys on both sides of the handshake, provided that it completes successfully on each endpoint (see <a href="#CK01" class="xref">[CK01]</a>, Definition 1, part 1).</dd>
<dt>Secrecy of the session keys:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The shared session keys should be known only to the communicating parties and not to the attacker (see <a href="#CK01" class="xref">[CK01]</a>, Definition 1, part 2). Note that in a unilaterally authenticated connection, the attacker can establish its own session keys with the server, but those session keys are distinct from those established by the client.</dd>
<dt>Peer authentication:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The client's view of the peer identity should reflect the server's identity. If the client is authenticated, the server's view of the peer identity should match the client's identity.</dd>
<dt>Uniqueness of the session keys:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Any two distinct handshakes should produce distinct, unrelated session keys. Individual session keys produced by a handshake should also be distinct and independent.</dd>
<dt>Downgrade protection:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The cryptographic parameters should be the same on both sides and should be the same as if the peers had been communicating in the absence of an attack (see <a href="#BBFGKZ16" class="xref">[BBFGKZ16]</a>, Definitions 8 and 9).</dd>
<dt>Forward secret with respect to long-term keys:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">If the long-term keying material (in this case the signature keys in certificate-based authentication modes or the external/resumption PSK in PSK with (EC)DHE modes) is compromised after the handshake is complete, this does not compromise the security of the session key (see <a href="#DOW92" class="xref">[DOW92]</a>), as long as the session key itself has been erased. The forward secrecy property is not satisfied when PSK is used in the "psk_ke" PskKeyExchangeMode.</dd>
<dt>Key Compromise Impersonation (KCI) resistance:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">In a mutually authenticated connection with certificates, compromising the long&#8209;term secret of one actor should not break that actor's authentication of their peer in the given connection (see <a href="#HGFS15" class="xref">[HGFS15]</a>). For example, if a client's signature key is compromised, it should not be possible to impersonate arbitrary servers to that client in subsequent handshakes.</dd>
<dt>Protection of endpoint identities:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The server's identity (certificate) should be protected against passive attackers. The client's identity should be protected against both passive and active attackers.</dd>
</dl>
<p id="rfc.section.E.1.p.5">Informally, the signature-based modes of TLS 1.3 provide for the establishment of a unique, secret, shared key established by an (EC)DHE key exchange and authenticated by the server's signature over the handshake transcript, as well as tied to the server's identity by a MAC. If the client is authenticated by a certificate, it also signs over the handshake transcript and provides a MAC tied to both identities. <a href="#SIGMA" class="xref">[SIGMA]</a> describes the design and analysis of this type of key exchange protocol. If fresh (EC)DHE keys are used for each connection, then the output keys are forward secret.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.1.p.6">The external PSK and resumption PSK bootstrap from a long-term shared secret into a unique per-connection set of short-term session keys. This secret may have been established in a previous handshake. If PSK with (EC)DHE key establishment is used, these session keys will also be forward secret. The resumption PSK has been designed so that the resumption master secret computed by connection N and needed to form connection N+1 is separate from the traffic keys used by connection N, thus providing forward secrecy between the connections.  In addition, if multiple tickets are established on the same connection, they are associated with different keys, so compromise of the PSK associated with one ticket does not lead to the compromise of connections established with PSKs associated with other tickets.  This property is most interesting if tickets are stored in a database (and so can be deleted) rather than if they are self-encrypted.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.1.p.7">The PSK binder value forms a binding between a PSK and the current handshake, as well as between the session where the PSK was established and the current session. This binding transitively includes the original handshake transcript, because that transcript is digested into the values which produce the resumption master secret. This requires that both the KDF used to produce the resumption master secret and the MAC used to compute the binder be collision resistant. See <a href="#key-derivation-and-hkdf" class="xref">Appendix E.1.1</a> for more on this.  Note: The binder does not cover the binder values from other PSKs, though they are included in the Finished MAC.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.1.p.8">TLS does not currently permit the server to send a certificate_request message in non-certificate-based handshakes (e.g., PSK).  If this restriction were to be relaxed in future, the client's signature would not cover the server's certificate directly.  However, if the PSK was established through a NewSessionTicket, the client's signature would transitively cover the server's certificate through the PSK binder. <a href="#PSK-FINISHED" class="xref">[PSK-FINISHED]</a> describes a concrete attack on constructions that do not bind to the server's certificate (see also <a href="#Kraw16" class="xref">[Kraw16]</a>). It is unsafe to use certificate-based client authentication when the client might potentially share the same PSK&#8288;/key-id pair with two different endpoints.  Implementations MUST&#160;NOT combine external PSKs with certificate-based authentication of either the client or the server unless negotiated by some extension.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.1.p.9">If an exporter is used, then it produces values which are unique and secret (because they are generated from a unique session key).  Exporters computed with different labels and contexts are computationally independent, so it is not feasible to compute one from another or the session secret from the exported value. Note:&#160;Exporters can produce arbitrary-length values; if exporters are to be used as channel bindings, the exported value MUST be large enough to provide collision resistance. The exporters provided in TLS 1.3 are derived from the same Handshake Contexts as the early traffic keys and the application traffic keys, respectively, and thus have similar security properties. Note that they do not include the client's certificate; future applications which wish to bind to the client's certificate may need to define a new exporter that includes the full handshake transcript.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.1.p.10">For all handshake modes, the Finished MAC (and, where present, the signature) prevents downgrade attacks. In addition, the use of certain bytes in the random nonces as described in <a href="#server-hello" class="xref">Section 4.1.3</a> allows the detection of downgrade to previous TLS versions.  See <a href="#BBFGKZ16" class="xref">[BBFGKZ16]</a> for more details on TLS 1.3 and downgrade.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.1.p.11">As soon as the client and the server have exchanged enough information to establish shared keys, the remainder of the handshake is encrypted, thus providing protection against passive attackers, even if the computed shared key is not authenticated. Because the server authenticates before the client, the client can ensure that if it authenticates to the server, it only reveals its identity to an authenticated server. Note that implementations must use the provided record-padding mechanism during the handshake to avoid leaking information about the identities due to length.  The client's proposed PSK identities are not encrypted, nor is the one that the server selects.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.E.1.1.p.1">Key derivation in TLS 1.3 uses HKDF as defined in <a href="#RFC5869" class="xref">[RFC5869]</a> and its two components, HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand.

Throughout this document, each application of HKDF-Extract is followed by one or more invocations of HKDF-Expand. This ordering should always be followed (including in future revisions of this document); in particular, one SHOULD NOT use an output of HKDF-Extract as an input to another application of HKDF-Extract without an HKDF-Expand in between. Multiple applications of HKDF-Expand to some of the same inputs are allowed as long as these are differentiated via the key and/or the labels.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.1.1.p.2">Note that HKDF-Expand implements a pseudorandom function (PRF) with both inputs and outputs of variable length. In some of the uses of HKDF in this document (e.g., for generating exporters and the resumption_master_secret), it is necessary that the application of HKDF-Expand be collision resistant; namely, it should be infeasible to find two different inputs to HKDF-Expand that output the same value. This requires the underlying hash function to be collision resistant and the output length from HKDF-Expand to be of size at least 256 bits (or as much as needed for the hash function to prevent finding collisions).</p>

See <a href="#CHHSV17" class="xref">[CHHSV17]</a> for details. In addition, the analysis of post&#8209;handshake authentication from <a href="#Kraw16" class="xref">[Kraw16]</a> shows that the client identified by the certificate sent in the post-handshake phase possesses the traffic key.

</dl>
<p id="rfc.section.E.2.p.3">Informally, TLS 1.3 provides these properties by AEAD-protecting the plaintext with a strong key. AEAD encryption <a href="#RFC5116" class="xref">[RFC5116]</a> provides confidentiality and integrity for the data. Non-replayability is provided by using a separate nonce for each record, with the nonce being derived from the record sequence number (<a href="#nonce" class="xref">Section 5.3</a>), with the sequence number being maintained independently at both sides; thus, records which are delivered out of order result in AEAD deprotection failures.  In order to prevent mass cryptanalysis when the same plaintext is repeatedly encrypted by different users under the same key (as is commonly the case for HTTP), the nonce is formed by mixing the sequence number with a secret per-connection initialization vector derived along with the traffic keys.  See <a href="#BT16" class="xref">[BT16]</a> for analysis of this construction.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.2.p.4">The rekeying technique in TLS 1.3 (see <a href="#updating-traffic-keys" class="xref">Section 7.2</a>) follows the construction of the serial generator as discussed in <a href="#REKEY" class="xref">[REKEY]</a>, which shows that rekeying can allow keys to be used for a larger number of encryptions than without rekeying. This relies on the security of the HKDF&#8209;Expand-Label function as a pseudorandom function (PRF).  In addition, as long as this function is truly one way, it is not possible to compute traffic keys from prior to a key change (forward secrecy).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.2.p.5">TLS does not provide security for data which is communicated on a connection after a traffic secret of that connection is compromised. That is, TLS does not provide post-compromise security/future secrecy/backward secrecy with respect to the traffic secret.

<p id="rfc.section.E.3.p.2">TLS does not provide any specific defenses against this form of attack but does include a padding mechanism for use by applications: The plaintext protected by the AEAD function consists of content plus variable-length padding, which allows the application to produce arbitrary-length encrypted records as well as padding-only cover traffic to conceal the difference between periods of transmission and periods of silence. Because the padding is encrypted alongside the actual content, an attacker cannot directly determine the length of the padding but may be able to measure it indirectly by the use of timing channels exposed during record processing (i.e., seeing how long it takes to process a record or trickling in records to see which ones elicit a response from the server). In general, it is not known how to remove all of these channels because even a constant&#8209;time padding removal function will likely feed the content into data-dependent functions.  At minimum, a fully constant-time server or client would require close cooperation with the application-layer protocol implementation, including making that higher-level protocol constant time.</p>

However, certain features of TLS are designed to make it easier to write side-channel resistant code:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Unlike previous versions of TLS which used a composite MAC-then-encrypt structure, TLS 1.3 only uses AEAD algorithms, allowing implementations to use self-contained constant-time implementations of those primitives.</li>
<li>TLS uses a uniform "bad_record_mac" alert for all decryption errors, which is intended to prevent an attacker from gaining piecewise insight into portions of the message.  Additional resistance is provided by terminating the connection on such errors; a new connection will have different cryptographic material, preventing attacks against the cryptographic primitives that require multiple trials.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.E.4.p.3">Information leakage through side channels can occur at layers above TLS, in application protocols and the applications that use them.

Potential attacks include:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Duplication of actions which cause side effects (e.g., purchasing an item or transferring money) to be duplicated, thus harming the site or the user.</li>
<li>Attackers can store and replay 0-RTT messages in order to reorder them with respect to other messages (e.g., moving a delete to after a create).</li>

The mechanisms described in <a href="#anti-replay" class="xref">Section 8</a> are intended to prevent replay at the TLS layer but do not provide complete protection against receiving multiple copies of client data.  TLS 1.3 falls back to the 1-RTT handshake when the server does not have any information about the client, e.g., because it is in a different cluster which does not share state or because the ticket has been deleted as described in <a href="#single-use-tickets" class="xref">Section 8.1</a>. If the application-layer protocol retransmits data in this setting, then it is possible for an attacker to induce message duplication by sending the ClientHello to both the original cluster (which processes the data immediately) and another cluster which will fall back to 1-RTT and process the data upon application-layer replay. The scale of this attack is limited by the client's willingness to retry transactions and therefore only allows a limited amount of duplication, with each copy appearing as a new connection at the server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.5.p.5">If implemented correctly, the mechanisms described in Sections&#160;<a href="#single-use-tickets" class="xref">8.1</a> and <a href="#client-hello-recording" class="xref">8.2</a> prevent a replayed ClientHello and its associated 0-RTT data from being accepted multiple times by any cluster with consistent state; for servers which limit the use of 0-RTT to one cluster for a single ticket, then a given ClientHello and its associated 0-RTT data will only be accepted once.  However, if state is not completely consistent, then an attacker might be able to have multiple copies of the data be accepted during the replication window.  Because clients do not know the exact details of server behavior, they MUST NOT send messages in early data which are not safe to have replayed and which they would not be willing to retry across multiple 1-RTT connections.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.5.p.6">Application protocols MUST NOT use 0-RTT data without a profile that defines its use. That profile needs to identify which messages or interactions are safe to use with 0-RTT and how to handle the situation when the server rejects 0-RTT and falls back to 1-RTT.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.5.p.7">In addition, to avoid accidental misuse, TLS implementations MUST NOT enable 0-RTT (either sending or accepting) unless specifically requested by the application and MUST NOT automatically resend 0-RTT data if it is rejected by the server unless instructed by the application. Server-side applications may wish to implement special processing for 0-RTT data for some kinds of application traffic (e.g., abort the connection, request that data be resent at the application layer, or delay processing until the handshake completes). In order to allow applications to implement this kind of processing, TLS implementations MUST provide a way for the application to determine if the handshake has completed.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.E.5.1.p.1">Replays of the ClientHello produce the same early exporter, thus requiring additional care by applications which use these exporters.  In particular, if these exporters are used as an authentication channel binding (e.g., by signing the output of the exporter), an attacker who compromises the PSK can transplant authenticators between connections without compromising the authentication key.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.5.1.p.2">In addition, the early exporter SHOULD NOT be used to generate server-to-client encryption keys because that would entail the reuse of those keys. This parallels the use of the early application traffic keys only in the client-to-server direction.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.E.6.p.1">Because implementations respond to an invalid PSK binder by aborting the handshake, it may be possible for an attacker to verify whether a given PSK identity is valid. Specifically, if a server accepts both external-PSK handshakes and certificate-based handshakes, a valid PSK identity will result in a failed handshake, whereas an invalid identity will just be skipped and result in a successful certificate handshake.  Servers which solely support PSK handshakes may be able to resist this form of attack by treating the cases where there is no valid PSK identity and where there is an identity but it has an invalid binder identically.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.E.7">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.E.7">E.7.</a> <a href="#sharing-psks" id="sharing-psks">Sharing PSKs</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.E.7.p.1">TLS 1.3 takes a conservative approach to PSKs by binding them to a specific KDF. By contrast, TLS 1.2 allows PSKs to be used with any hash function and the TLS 1.2 PRF. Thus, any PSK which is used with both TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 must be used with only one hash in TLS 1.3, which is less than optimal if users want to provision a single PSK.  The constructions in TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are different, although they are both based on HMAC. While there is no known way in which the same PSK might produce related output in both versions, only limited analysis has been done. Implementations can ensure safety from cross-protocol related output by not reusing PSKs between TLS 1.3 and TLS 1.2.  </p>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.E.8">E.8.</a> <a href="#attacks-on-static-rsa" id="attacks-on-static-rsa">Attacks on Static RSA</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.E.8.p.1">Although TLS 1.3 does not use RSA key transport and so is not directly susceptible to Bleichenbacher-type attacks <a href="#Blei98" class="xref">[Blei98]</a>, if TLS 1.3 servers also support static RSA in the context of previous versions of TLS, then it may be possible to impersonate the server for TLS 1.3 connections <a href="#JSS15" class="xref">[JSS15]</a>. TLS 1.3 implementations can prevent this attack by disabling support for static RSA across all versions of TLS. In principle, implementations might also be able to separate certificates with different keyUsage bits for static RSA decryption and RSA signature, but this technique relies on clients refusing to accept signatures using keys in certificates that do not have the digitalSignature bit set, and many clients do not enforce this restriction.</p>
